 ## Lessons Learned

 :tada:  


 #### Besart Aliju

 Working on this project was challenging, yet rewarding. It reinforced my love of coding and often times while working on this project, I remembered why I enjoyed coding so much in the first place. Learning new technologies and trying to pick them up as fast as possible to incorporate them is very exciting to me. Ideally, in this application, I would have liked to have incorporated some sort of machine learning algorithms in this application such as recommending items based upon linear classifiers or through the use of support vector machines.

 #### Jetlir Lajqi

 Similar to what Besart said, working on this project was tough but rewarding. Often times when I am looking for things to code, I end up reading a lot about the tools to use for projects depending on what kind of project I would like to do, but I end up spending no time actually working on a project. Before I know it, the school semester is here again and I will have little time to work on an impactful project. For this assignment, it made building a project fun because there is an end goal in mind given by someone else. Of course, after this course is over, I can go back and modify it; having the end goal in mind makes building the project easier. I am more of a visual person, so I would have liked to have had a material design GUI. Often times, lazy designers just use a bootstrap template, but I wanted to design something from the ground up.


 ## Some Failures
 Connecting our front-end to the database proved to be somewhat of a challenge. __Django__ has it's own Template Language which allows for the use of writing dynamic HTML, however, connecting that to the back-end was difficult. As a result, sometimes our website seems to function depending on certain parameters and some other times, not so much.

 Looking back at it now, we might have considered not using Django, and preferring to use a more basic platform such as Python coupled with Tk or with Qt. Unfortunately, Django had just released a new version of their framework, 1.10, so as a result, there was official documentation, but we felt as though there was a lack of user support on forums such as StackOverflow.
 We opted to go with Django, over Flask, because it includes a lot of boilerplate code which makes it slightly easier to get off the ground and running. However, their template language and URL routing system proved to be confusing. As an example, we found that the URL routing system uses regular expression patterns to match urls.

## Conclusion

Both Jetlir and I plan on continuing to work on this project once the semester is over, because it was fun to work on. Programming can be extremely fun and it is! Sure, sometimes sitting in front of the screen for an hour trying to figure out one minor problem is annoying, but those are the bad parts that come with the good parts. I am glad I chose Computer Science as a major because I couldn't imagine doing anything else besides programming.
